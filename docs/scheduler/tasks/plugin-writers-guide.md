# Plugin Writer's Guide

## Overview

This guide provides practical, step-by-step instructions for integrating the Pre/Post Schedule Tasks system into your plugin. Rather than learning abstract concepts, this guide focuses on the concrete implementation steps needed to transform your plugin from manual resource management to declarative requirement specification.

## Understanding the Integration Process

### The Transformation Journey

Integrating the task system involves transforming your plugin from imperative resource management to declarative requirement specification. This transformation typically improves plugin reliability, reduces user setup burden, and standardizes behavior across the plugin ecosystem.

### Integration Complexity Levels

**Basic Integration**: Simple requirement definition with minimal custom logic, suitable for straightforward skilling or combat plugins.

**Intermediate Integration**: Multiple requirement types with some custom preparation logic, typical for specialized activities or minigames.

**Advanced Integration**: Complex requirement combinations, conditional logic, and sophisticated custom task implementations for high-end automation systems.

## Prerequisites and Planning

### Evaluation Phase

Before beginning integration, evaluate your plugin's current resource management patterns:

**Manual Operations**: Identify operations users currently perform manually before starting your plugin - these become candidates for requirement automation.

**Resource Dependencies**: Catalog items, equipment, locations, and game state conditions your plugin needs to function effectively.

**Failure Points**: Examine common failure modes in your current plugin and determine which could be prevented through proper requirement fulfillment.

### Architecture Planning

Plan your integration approach based on your plugin's complexity:

**Simple Plugins**: Focus primarily on requirement definition with minimal custom task logic.

**Complex Plugins**: Design custom task implementations for plugin-specific operations that cannot be expressed as standard requirements.

**Ecosystem Plugins**: Consider integration with other scheduler-aware plugins and shared resource coordination.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Requirements Analysis and Design

Begin by analyzing your plugin's resource needs and designing appropriate requirements:

**Equipment Analysis**: Determine optimal equipment for your plugin's activities, considering alternatives and upgrade paths.

**Location Strategy**: Identify key locations your plugin operates in and determine positioning requirements.

**Resource Planning**: Catalog consumables, tools, and other items needed for successful plugin execution.

**State Dependencies**: Identify spellbook requirements, quest prerequisites, and other game state conditions.

Study the [`ExamplePrePostScheduleRequirements`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/examples/ExamplePrePostScheduleRequirements.java) implementation to understand requirement definition patterns.

### Step 2: Requirements Implementation

Create your requirements class extending [`PrePostScheduleRequirements`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/requirements/PrePostScheduleRequirements.java):

**Class Structure**: Implement the abstract `initializeRequirements()` method to define all requirements your plugin needs.

**Registry Usage**: Use the provided registry to register requirements with appropriate priorities and contexts.

**Collection Integration**: Leverage [`ItemRequirementCollection`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/requirements/data/ItemRequirementCollection.java) for standard equipment sets rather than defining individual items.

**Context Assignment**: Assign requirements to appropriate contexts (PRE_SCHEDULE, POST_SCHEDULE, BOTH) based on when they should be fulfilled.

### Step 3: Task Manager Implementation

Create your task manager extending [`AbstractPrePostScheduleTasks`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/AbstractPrePostScheduleTasks.java):

**Core Methods**: Implement the required abstract methods, focusing on custom logic that cannot be expressed as requirements.

**Error Handling**: Design robust error handling strategies for custom operations, considering both recoverable and non-recoverable failures.

**Resource Management**: Ensure proper cleanup in custom task implementations, following the established patterns for resource lifecycle management.

**Integration Hooks**: Implement scheduler detection logic to ensure task execution only occurs when appropriate.

Reference the [`ExamplePrePostScheduleTasks`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/examples/ExamplePrePostScheduleTasks.java) for implementation patterns and best practices.

### Step 4: Plugin Integration

Modify your main plugin class to integrate with the task system:

**Interface Implementation**: Implement the enhanced [`SchedulablePlugin`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/api/SchedulablePlugin.java) interface to enable scheduler integration.

**Lifecycle Modification**: Modify startup and shutdown procedures to execute tasks when appropriate while maintaining backward compatibility for non-scheduler usage.

**Event Handling**: Implement scheduler event handlers to respond to stop requests and other scheduler coordination events.

**State Management**: Ensure proper coordination between task execution and main plugin logic to prevent interference.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation

Develop comprehensive testing strategies to ensure reliable integration:

**Requirement Testing**: Validate that all requirements can be fulfilled under various game conditions and resource availability scenarios.

**Integration Testing**: Test the complete lifecycle from requirement fulfillment through main plugin execution to cleanup operations.

**Edge Case Testing**: Verify behavior when requirements cannot be fulfilled, when operations time out, and when emergency cancellation is triggered.

**Performance Testing**: Ensure task execution doesn't negatively impact main plugin performance or introduce unacceptable delays.

## Advanced Implementation Patterns

### Complex Requirement Combinations

For activities requiring sophisticated resource coordination:

**OR Requirements**: Use logical requirements to specify alternatives when multiple valid approaches exist.

**Conditional Requirements**: Implement state-dependent requirements that adapt to current game conditions.

**Hierarchical Planning**: Design requirement hierarchies for complex activities with multiple phases or optional enhancements.

### Custom Task Implementation

For plugin-specific operations beyond standard requirements:

**Preparation Logic**: Implement custom pre-schedule tasks for plugin initialization, state validation, or specialized setup procedures.

**Cleanup Operations**: Design custom post-schedule tasks for data persistence, state restoration, or plugin-specific resource management.

**Integration Coordination**: Coordinate with other systems or plugins through custom task implementations when standard requirements are insufficient.

### Performance Optimization

Optimize task performance for smooth user experience:

**Asynchronous Operations**: Design tasks to utilize asynchronous patterns where appropriate to maintain responsiveness.

**Resource Efficiency**: Minimize resource usage during task execution to prevent interference with main plugin operations.

**Caching Strategies**: Implement intelligent caching for expensive operations while maintaining accuracy through proper invalidation.

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Requirement Conflicts

Address potential conflicts between requirements:

**Resource Competition**: Handle scenarios where multiple requirements compete for limited resources.

**Timing Conflicts**: Resolve conflicts between requirements that must be fulfilled in specific orders.

**State Inconsistencies**: Design strategies for handling inconsistent game state during requirement fulfillment.

### Error Recovery

Implement robust error recovery strategies:

**Graceful Degradation**: Design fallback strategies when optimal requirements cannot be fulfilled.

**User Communication**: Provide clear feedback about requirement fulfillment status and any issues encountered.

**Retry Logic**: Implement intelligent retry strategies for transient failures while avoiding infinite loops.

### Integration Complexity

Manage complexity in sophisticated integrations:

**Code Organization**: Structure your implementation to maintain clear separation between requirement definition, task management, and main plugin logic.

**Configuration Management**: Design configuration interfaces that expose appropriate task system options to users.

**Debugging Support**: Implement comprehensive logging and debugging support to aid in troubleshooting integration issues.

## Real-World Examples

**Requirement Organization**: Study how production implementations organize and structure their requirements for maintainability.

**Error Handling**: Examine real-world error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms.

**User Experience**: Understand how production plugins balance automation with user control and feedback.

## Best Practices and Guidelines

### Code Quality

Maintain high code quality in your integration:

**Clear Separation**: Keep requirement definition, task implementation, and main plugin logic clearly separated.

**Comprehensive Testing**: Implement thorough testing for all aspects of your integration.

**Documentation**: Document your requirements and custom task logic for future maintenance.

### User Experience

Design your integration with user experience in mind:

**Predictable Behavior**: Ensure task execution is predictable and provides appropriate feedback.

**Graceful Failures**: Handle failures gracefully with clear error messages and recovery suggestions.

**Performance Impact**: Minimize the performance impact of task execution on overall plugin responsiveness.

### Maintenance and Evolution

Design for long-term maintenance:

**Extensible Architecture**: Structure your implementation to accommodate future enhancements.

**Version Compatibility**: Ensure your integration remains compatible with system updates.

**Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation current as your implementation evolves.

The integration process requires careful planning and attention to detail, but the result is more reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly plugin automation. Focus on understanding the concepts before implementing, and don't hesitate to study the example implementations for guidance on best practices and common patterns.
