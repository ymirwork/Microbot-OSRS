# Enhanced SchedulablePlugin API

## Overview

The Enhanced SchedulablePlugin API represents an evolution from the original SchedulablePlugin interface, introducing comprehensive task management capabilities that standardize plugin automation while maintaining flexibility for diverse implementation needs. This API transforms plugin development from manual resource coordination to declarative requirement specification.

## Architectural Evolution

### From Manual to Declarative

The enhanced API shifts plugin development philosophy from imperative resource management to declarative requirement specification. Instead of implementing complex resource acquisition logic within your plugin, you describe what your plugin needs, and the task system handles the execution details.

### Integration Philosophy

The API is designed around the principle of seamless integration - plugins enhanced with task management capabilities should function identically whether used standalone or within the scheduler environment. This dual-mode operation ensures backward compatibility while enabling advanced automation features.

### System Coordination

Enhanced plugins participate in a broader ecosystem where resource coordination, conflict resolution, and user experience standardization are handled at the system level rather than requiring individual plugin implementations.

## Core Interface Components

### Enhanced SchedulablePlugin Interface

The primary interface extends the basic SchedulablePlugin with task management capabilities:

**Task Management Integration**: Methods for coordinating with the task execution system, enabling plugins to participate in comprehensive automation workflows.

**Lifecycle Coordination**: Enhanced lifecycle methods that integrate with the scheduler's execution model while maintaining plugin autonomy.

**Event Handling**: Standardized event handling for scheduler interactions, allowing plugins to respond appropriately to system coordination events.

Reference the complete interface definition in [`SchedulablePlugin`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/api/SchedulablePlugin.java) for detailed method specifications.

### Task Provider Integration

Enhanced plugins can provide task management capabilities through the system's provider pattern:

**Task Manager Provision**: Plugins supply task manager instances that handle resource preparation and cleanup operations.

**Requirement Specification**: Declarative requirement definition that describes plugin resource needs without implementing acquisition logic.

**Configuration Integration**: Integration with the scheduler's configuration system for coordinated user experience across plugin and task management.

## Implementation Architecture

### Dual-Mode Operation

Enhanced plugins must support both standalone and scheduler-managed operation:

**Standalone Functionality**: Complete plugin functionality when operating independently, maintaining existing user workflows and expectations.

**Scheduler Integration**: Enhanced capabilities when operating within the scheduler environment, leveraging centralized resource management and coordination.

**Detection Logic**: Intelligent detection of the operational context to enable appropriate behavior in each mode.

### Resource Coordination

The API facilitates sophisticated resource coordination:

**Shared Resource Management**: Coordination with other system components for shared resources like banking, equipment management, and location positioning.

**Conflict Resolution**: Participation in system-level conflict resolution when multiple plugins or operations compete for limited resources.

**State Synchronization**: Coordination with the scheduler's state management to ensure consistent operation across complex automation workflows.

### Configuration Architecture

Enhanced plugins integrate with the scheduler's configuration system:

**Unified Configuration**: Seamless integration between plugin-specific configuration and task management settings.

**User Experience Consistency**: Standardized configuration patterns that provide consistent user experience across different plugin types.

**Dynamic Configuration**: Support for runtime configuration changes that affect both plugin behavior and task management strategies.

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Complex Workflow Coordination

For sophisticated automation scenarios:

**Multi-Phase Operations**: Support for complex operations that span multiple game activities or require sophisticated state transitions.

**Conditional Execution**: Dynamic adaptation based on game state, resource availability, or user preferences.

**Cross-Plugin Coordination**: Integration with other enhanced plugins for coordinated automation workflows.

### Error Handling and Recovery

Robust error handling strategies for enhanced plugins:

**Graceful Degradation**: Intelligent fallback strategies when optimal conditions cannot be achieved.

**State Recovery**: Restoration of proper state when operations are interrupted or fail.

**User Communication**: Clear communication of status, issues, and recovery actions to maintain user awareness and control.

### Performance and Responsiveness

Design considerations for maintaining optimal performance:

**Asynchronous Operations**: Integration with asynchronous execution patterns to maintain system responsiveness.

**Resource Efficiency**: Efficient resource utilization that minimizes impact on game performance and user experience.

**Scalability**: Design patterns that support multiple concurrent enhanced plugins without degrading system performance.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Interface Implementation Strategy

Approach enhanced plugin implementation systematically:

**Incremental Enhancement**: Add enhanced capabilities to existing plugins without disrupting core functionality.

**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive testing in both standalone and scheduler-managed modes to ensure reliable operation.

**Compatibility Maintenance**: Preserve existing plugin behavior while adding enhanced capabilities.

### Best Practices

Follow established patterns for reliable enhanced plugin development:

**Clear Separation**: Maintain clear separation between core plugin logic and enhanced task management capabilities.

**Robust Integration**: Design integration points that handle edge cases gracefully and provide appropriate fallback behavior.

**User Experience**: Prioritize user experience consistency across different operational modes.

### Common Integration Challenges

Understand and address typical implementation challenges:

**State Management**: Coordinate plugin state with task execution state to prevent conflicts or inconsistencies.

**Resource Competition**: Handle scenarios where plugin needs conflict with system resource management.

**Timing Coordination**: Ensure proper timing between plugin operations and task execution phases.

**Integration Testing**: Test coordination with task management system and other system components.

**Edge Case Testing**: Verify behavior under unusual conditions, resource constraints, and error scenarios.

### Performance Validation

Ensure enhanced plugins maintain acceptable performance:

**Resource Usage**: Monitor resource consumption in enhanced mode to prevent performance degradation.

**Responsiveness**: Validate that enhanced capabilities don't negatively impact user interface responsiveness.

**Scalability**: Test behavior when multiple enhanced plugins operate concurrently.
