# Requirements Integration

## Overview

Requirements integration represents the bridge between high-level plugin needs and concrete automation actions. This system transforms abstract requirements like "equipped for combat" or "positioned for mining" into specific, executable operations that prepare the game environment for plugin operation.

## Integration Philosophy

### Declarative Resource Management

The requirements integration system embodies a declarative approach to resource management. Rather than implementing complex resource acquisition logic within each plugin, developers describe their needs using standardized requirement types, and the integration system handles the execution details.

### Contextual Execution

Requirements are fulfilled within specific contexts that determine when and how they should be executed. This contextual framework ensures requirements are fulfilled at appropriate times without interfering with plugin operation or creating user experience disruptions.

### Extensible Foundation

The integration architecture is designed for extensibility, allowing new requirement types to be added seamlessly while maintaining compatibility with existing implementations. This extensibility ensures the system can evolve to support new gameplay patterns and automation needs.

## Integration Architecture

### Registry-Based Management

The integration system uses a registry-based architecture for requirement management:

**Centralized Registration**: All requirements are registered through the [`RequirementRegistry`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/requirements/registry/RequirementRegistry.java), providing centralized management and coordination.

**Type System**: Requirements are organized by type, allowing for specialized handling of different resource categories like equipment, inventory, location, and game state.

**Priority Management**: The registry manages requirement priorities, ensuring critical requirements are fulfilled before optional enhancements.

**Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent conflict resolution handles scenarios where requirements conflict or compete for limited resources.

### Execution Framework

Requirements are executed through a sophisticated framework that coordinates timing, resource management, and error handling:

**Context-Aware Execution**: Requirements execute within appropriate contexts (PRE_SCHEDULE, POST_SCHEDULE, BOTH) based on their nature and timing requirements.

**Resource Coordination**: The execution framework coordinates access to shared resources like banking, equipment management, and location positioning.

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures failed requirements don't prevent other operations and provide appropriate user feedback.

**Performance Optimization**: Intelligent execution patterns minimize overhead while maintaining reliability and user experience quality.

## Core Integration Components

### Requirement Type Ecosystem

The system includes a comprehensive ecosystem of requirement types:

**Equipment Requirements**: Managed through [`ItemRequirement`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/requirements/requirement/item/ItemRequirement.java) for automated equipment optimization and management.

**Inventory Requirements**: Handled by [`ItemRequirement`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/requirements/requirement/item/ItemRequirement.java) for complex inventory preparation and item management.

**Location Requirements**: Coordinated through [`LocationRequirement`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/requirements/requirement/location/LocationRequirement.java) for precise positioning and area preparation.

**Game State Requirements**: Various specialized requirements for spellbooks, prayers, and other game state conditions.

### Collection-Based Organization

Related requirements are organized into collections for easier management:

**Equipment Collections**: [`ItemRequirementCollection`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/requirements/data/ItemRequirementCollection.java) provides standardized equipment sets for common activities.

**Activity-Specific Collections**: Specialized collections for specific activities like combat, skilling, or minigames that combine multiple requirement types.

**User-Customizable Collections**: Support for user-defined requirement collections that can be shared across multiple plugins or activities.

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Conditional Requirements

The system supports sophisticated conditional requirement patterns:

**State-Dependent Requirements**: Requirements that adapt based on current game state, player progress, or environmental conditions.

**Logical Combinations**: OR requirements that specify alternatives when multiple valid approaches exist for achieving the same goal.

**Hierarchical Dependencies**: Complex requirement hierarchies where fulfilling one requirement enables or modifies others.

**Dynamic Adaptation**: Requirements that modify their behavior based on execution context or previous fulfillment attempts.

### Resource Optimization

Intelligent resource optimization ensures efficient requirement fulfillment:

**Shared Resource Detection**: Automatic detection of shared resource needs across multiple requirements to optimize fulfillment order.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Intelligent analysis of fulfillment costs to choose optimal approaches when multiple options exist.

**Resource Caching**: Strategic caching of expensive operations to improve performance across multiple requirement executions.

**Batch Processing**: Optimization of related requirements to minimize repeated operations and resource access.

### Error Recovery and Resilience

Comprehensive error recovery ensures robust requirement integration:

**Graceful Degradation**: Intelligent fallback strategies when optimal requirements cannot be fulfilled.

**Partial Fulfillment**: Support for partial requirement fulfillment when complete fulfillment is not possible.

**Retry Strategies**: Sophisticated retry logic for transient failures with appropriate backoff and timeout handling.

**User Feedback**: Clear communication of requirement status, issues, and recovery actions to maintain user awareness.

## Implementation Strategies

### Basic Integration Approach

For straightforward plugin integration:

**Requirement Identification**: Systematically identify plugin resource needs and map them to appropriate requirement types.

**Registry Configuration**: Configure the requirement registry with appropriate requirements, priorities, and contexts.

**Testing Validation**: Comprehensive testing to ensure requirement fulfillment works reliably under various game conditions.

Study the [`ExamplePrePostScheduleRequirements`](../../../runelite-client/src/main/java/net/runelite/client/plugins/microbot/pluginscheduler/tasks/examples/ExamplePrePostScheduleRequirements.java) for basic integration patterns.

### Advanced Integration Techniques

**Custom Requirement Types**: Development of plugin-specific requirement types for specialized resource needs.

**Conditional Logic**: Implementation of sophisticated conditional requirements that adapt to game state and context.

**Cross-Plugin Coordination**: Integration with other plugins' requirements for coordinated resource management.

**Performance Optimization**: Advanced optimization techniques for high-performance requirement fulfillment.

### Integration Testing

Comprehensive testing strategies for requirement integration:

**Individual Requirement Testing**: Validation of each requirement type under various conditions and resource states.

**Integration Testing**: Testing complete requirement fulfillment workflows from registration through execution.

**Edge Case Validation**: Testing behavior under unusual conditions, resource constraints, and error scenarios.

**Performance Testing**: Validation that requirement fulfillment doesn't negatively impact plugin or system performance.

## Common Integration Challenges

### Resource Competition

Address scenarios where multiple requirements compete for limited resources:

**Priority Resolution**: Use requirement priorities to resolve conflicts between competing requirements.

**Resource Sharing**: Design requirements to share resources efficiently when possible.

**Conflict Detection**: Implement detection of resource conflicts before they cause fulfillment failures.
